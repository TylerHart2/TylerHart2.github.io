## Technologies Used 
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT
  -Library: jQuery

## Approach Taken

### First Page

After clicking the Link you are taken to the landing page where you have an option to start the game. The user will then click the button that will take them to the main Game Board. 

### Playing Field 

The User will guess a letter from the Keyboard. If the letter is correct it will Display the letter in one of the hidden boxes. If the user was successful in guessing, they will guess a new letter. However, if the users guess is incorrect. They will see the image change. The image will continue to change until a full body is hanging in the picture. 

### Win / Loss

If the Player wins or loses an alert will pop up displaying that information and then giving them the option to reset the game and play again.

### Challenging issues 

I originally took a lot of time trying to figure out how to change the image if a user was guessing incorrectly. 

### Unsolved problems

It does not seem to happen all the time but, every so often the last image breaks on the hangman gameboard.
